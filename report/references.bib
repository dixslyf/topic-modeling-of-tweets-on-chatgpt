abstract = {Latent variable models have the potential to add value to large document collections by discovering interpretable, low-dimensional subspaces. In order for people to use such models, however, they must trust them. Unfortunately, typical dimensionality reduction methods for text, such as latent Dirichlet allocation, often produce low-dimensional subspaces (topics) that are obviously flawed to human domain experts. The contributions of this paper are threefold: (1) An analysis of the ways in which topics can be flawed; (2) an automated evaluation metric for identifying such topics that does not rely on human annotators or reference collections outside the training data; (3) a novel statistical topic model based on this metric that significantly improves topic quality in a large-scale document collection from the National Institutes of Health (NIH).},

	abstract = {Quantifying the coherence of a set of statements is a long standing problem with many potential applications that has attracted researchers from different sciences. The special case of measuring coherence of topics has been recently studied to remedy the problem that topic models give no guaranty on the interpretablity of their output. Several benchmark datasets were produced that record human judgements of the interpretability of topics. We are the first to propose a framework that allows to construct existing word based coherence measures as well as new ones by combining elementary components. We conduct a systematic search of the space of coherence measures using all publicly available topic relevance data for the evaluation. Our results show that new combinations of components outperform existing measures with respect to correlation to human ratings. nFinally, we outline how our results can be transferred to further applications in the context of text mining, information retrieval and the world wide web.},

	abstract = {The new chatbot from artificial intelligence company OpenAI, called ChatGPT, has grown aggressively since its launch in late 2022. ChatGPT provides information back to users who populate questions in a clear and easy to understand structure. This technology can be used for different
purposes, including writing code, creating business proposals, writing stories and answering complex questions. Because this technology is considered a breakthrough in terms of its ability to process natural language, it stands to reason that it could have future effects on the fundamental
digital marketing tactic known as search engine optimisation (SEO), a process by which websites are developed and updated with the goal of increasing natural ranking, traffic and customers from search engines like Google and Bing. For the past 20 years, people have turned to search engines
for information, news articles, images, videos and answers to questions both mundane and complex. This technological advance with chatbots could indicate a significant general shift for marketers, specifically related to web searches and how marketers think about SEO. In fact, Microsoft's
decision to invest in ChatGPT and include it within their search engine, Bing, has already created waves in the search engine ecosystems. In this paper, ChatGPT will be examined, its capabilities and how they could affect search marketing and SEO.},
