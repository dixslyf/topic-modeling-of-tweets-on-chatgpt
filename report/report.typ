= Introduction

ChatGPT is a powerful language model developed by OpenAI
that has generated significant attention worldwide
and considerable discussion on social media platforms.
As its adoption grows,
many views have emerged about how ChatGPT~(and artificial intelligence, in general)
may impact
various sectors, including business, education and creative industries.
Understanding the public discourse surrounding ChatGPT
is a key step for grasping the implications of widely accessible artifical intelligence.

This report applies BERTopic, a topic modeling technique,
to analyze tweets from X~(formerly Twitter) about ChatGPT.
The objective is to identify the main topics discussed in tweets mentioning ChatGPT
in hopes of gaining insights into user perceptions and issues
regarding the increasingly wide accessibility of artificial intelligence.
Such insights can inform stakeholders about the technology's reception
and guide future developments and policies surrounding artficial intelligence.

The following sections detail the data collection and preprocessing steps
and describe the application of BERTopic,
before evaluating and presenting the results
and discussing their implications.
